What is conditional rendering?
-- In React, conditional rendering is the process of displaying different content based on certain conditions 
   or states. It allows you to create dynamic user interfaces that can adapt to changes in data and user 
   interactions.
-- React allows us to conditionally render components which means that the developer can decide which component 
   to render on the screen on on the basis of some predefined conditions. This is known as conditional rendering.

How to implement Conditional Rendering:
Two common ways are using the ternary operator and the && operator.

1) Ternary Operator:
function Greeting(props) {
  const isLoggedIn = props.isLoggedIn;
  return (
    <div>
      {isLoggedIn ? (
        <h1>Welcome back!</h1>
      ) : (
        <h1>Please sign up.</h1>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}

2) && Operator
function Greeting(props) {
  const isLoggedIn = props.isLoggedIn;
  return (
    <div>
      {isLoggedIn && <h1>Welcome back!</h1>}
    </div>
  );
}

Both of these methods are effective for conditionally rendering content in React. Which one to use often comes down 
to personal preference or the specific use case.The ternary operator may be more useful when there are multiple 
conditions to check, while the && operator can be simpler and more concise when there is only one condition.
