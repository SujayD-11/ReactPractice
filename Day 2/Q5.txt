What are the keys in react?  How to use the keys?

Definition: A “key” is a special string attribute you need to include when creating lists of elements in React. 
Keys are used in React to identify which items in the list are changed, updated, or deleted.

My Understanding:
Basically, when we create mulitle unnamed tags, the compiler throws us a warning stating that there
should be unique identifier for each tag. So the concept of Keys plays a vital role there. Keys are used to uniquely
identify the duplicated tags, by using which they can be updated, changed or deleted.

Implementation:
let arr = ["Sujay","Vijay","Ajay","Jay"]
let keyImplementedArray = arr.map((name, index)=>{   
    <li key={index}> {name} </li>;   
});  

Here index is the key, where in the implemented key nis autogenerated.
